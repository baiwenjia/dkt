1.	The description of demography of the subjects involved in the validation datasets is missing. 
2.	Since the proposed technique is designed for longitudinal studies, it would be interested to see the impact of the number of visits and the time of follow up.

1.	A better description of the generation of synthetic dataset would help to appreciate the validation.

2.	How many time visits and how long the follow up of each subjects is provided (is it homogeneous?)


In Method section, authors model both two functions using sigmoid function. It might be reasonable for the disease stage to a dysfunction score with the assumption that the function is a smooth monotonic. However, the trajectory of biomarker within agnostic unit is a function of mapping dysfunctionality score to biomarker value. 
It might not always be monotonically increasing. 

This also relates to the motivation of better interpretation than existing transfer learning methods. Unfortunately, authors did not show the detailed interpretation of the obtained results, but eave it as the future work. Hence, the motivation of the good interpretation of this method is not verified by the experiments.

In equation (1) and (2), the subscript j for the jth visit is missing. This confuses the understanding of this model on how it works. From the model, the model parameter beta and lambda should be related to each subject, so how is the model possible for the prediction of unseen data?



1. Solving the full model likelihood (3) is also very important for readers. However, not much details are given which will not help readers understand how model parameters are estimated. It is recommended to include a detailed algorithm here.


2. It is important to compare with other state-of-the-art models as authors claimed the contribution of the proposed DKT. Discussions with other transfer learning methods [4, 5] can be included in experiments to better see their limitations.
